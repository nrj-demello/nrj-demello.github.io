    <p>Q: What do you call a dead Tottenham Fan in a closet? 
        A: Last years winner of the hide and seek contest.</p>

    <p>Urban Dictionary: Tottenham Hotspurs are a bad football team that have not won a league championship since 1961. 
            Tottenham thought that they had struck gold when they signed Gareth Bale, and he soon became the team. 
            However he soon came to his senses and realised that Tottenham were terrible and left for a team 1000 times better. 
            Currently these clueless supporters just remember the good old days, not just when they had Bale, 
            but those 50 odd years ago when they actually won.</p>
