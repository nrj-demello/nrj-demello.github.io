    <p>Tottenham Hotspur is well known for cultivating crops of mediocre players. Ultimately, their careers stagnate and they retire with no meaningful sucess.
         Nonetheless, we must respect their ability to play with the knowledge that they will achieve no impressive accolades. 
     </p>

    <p>  
        The players pictured above are both prime examples of Tottenham flops. Roberto Soldado, was bought for £26 million in 2013-a club record at the time. 
        Subsequently, expectations were high. However, in typical Spurs fashion he failed to live up to those expecations. He went on to play 52 games Premier League games only scoring 7 times in the process.  
    </p>

     <p> We must admit that on the rare occassion the club has had some breakthrough stars. Most famously, Luca Modric and Gareth Bale became extraordinary players.
         However, this meant that they quickly outgrew the club, and their ambition of having a chance at winning trophies saw them leave as soon as they had the chance. 
         Both players joined Real Madrid and went on to be hugely successful careers.

            <span style="color: steelblue;"> "It’s the history of Tottenham. They always create many chances and score so much but, in the end, they miss always something to arrive at the end. We believe in history" </span>
